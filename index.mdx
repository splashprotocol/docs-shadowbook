Shadowbook is a proprietary orderbook decentralized exchange on Cardano. Unlike traditional AMM DEXs, Shadowbook implements a full on-chain orderbook. Makers place and manage limit orders, while takers get tight spreads and better prices for assets compared to traditional AMMs.

Shadowbook's mission is to solve the liquidity problem of the Cardano ecosystem by providing technology for maximum capital efficiency and the best user experience.

For performance reasons, our tech stack is built entirely in Rust.

## Cardano liquidity problem

Cardano’s smart contract platform does not currently support concentrated liquidity market maker pools or other capital-efficient designs. As a result, the market is dominated by constant-product AMM DEXs. While these models offer several benefits, they are not capital-efficient DeFi mechanisms and require substantial liquidity to function effectively.

This creates several compounding issues:

- **Slow price adjustment** — pool prices lag behind actual market movements, creating stale quotes.
- **Poor execution** — wide spreads and high slippage mean retail traders get worse prices.
- **High fees** — network fees of 1–1.5 ADA per order, combined with batcher and DEX fees, make frequent trading expensive.
- **Fragmented liquidity** — liquidity is scattered across multiple pools, venues, and trading pairs.

Loyal Cardano users bear the cost of all these inefficiencies.

## Shadowbook's solution

Shadowbook replaces the AMM model with an orderbook architecture specifically tailored for Cardano's eUTxO ledger.

### On-chain settlement

When a taker matches an order, the trade settles on-chain through Shadowbook’s smart contracts. Takers submit on-chain orders (limit or market), which the protocol executes once the specified conditions are met. The on-chain component manages custody, ensuring that takers retain full self-custody throughout the process. A typical market order, if fulfilled, is returned within the same block, providing users with a bespoke trading experience and maximum control over their funds.

### Capital efficiency

By concentrating maker liquidity in a real orderbook rather than spreading it across a bonding curve, Shadowbook delivers:

- **Tighter spreads** — makers quote competitive prices at specific levels instead of relying on a mathematical curve
- **Lower slippage** — aggregated depth at each price level means larger orders execute with less price impact
- **Dynamic Price** — The price remains dynamic enabling High-Frequency trading experience on top of Cardano

### Protocol integration

Shadowbook doesn't operate its own trading interface. Instead, it plugs into existing Cardano infrastructure as a liquidity source:

- **DexHunter** — live integration as a trading venue
- **Other DEXes and aggregators** — open for integrations

This means traders access Shadowbook's liquidity through the interfaces they already use, without needing to learn a new platform.
