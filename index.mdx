Shadowbook is a proprietary orderbook decentralized exchange (Prop DEX) on Cardano. Unlike traditional automated market maker (AMM) DEXes, Shadowbook implements a full on-chain orderbook matching engine. Makers place and manage limit orders, while takers get tight spreads and better prices for assets compared to traditional AMMs.

Shadowbook's mission is to solve the liquidity problem of the Cardano ecosystem by providing technology for maximum capital efficiency.

For performance reasons our tech stack is fully in Rust.

## Cardano liquidity problem

Cardano's smart contract platform doesn't support concentrated liquidity market maker pools or other capital-efficient designs. The market is dominated by constant product AMM DEXes — the least capital-efficient model in DeFi.

This creates several compounding issues:

- **Slow price adjustment** — pool prices lag behind actual market movements, creating stale quotes.
- **Poor execution** — wide spreads and high slippage mean retail traders get worse prices.
- **High fees** — network fees of 1–1.5 ADA per order, plus batcher and DEX fees, make frequent trading expensive.
- **Fragmented liquidity** — liquidity is scattered across multiple pools, venues, and trading pairs.

Loyal Cardano users bear the cost of all these inefficiencies.

## Shadowbook's solution

Shadowbook replaces the AMM model with a hybrid orderbook architecture designed for Cardano's eUTxO ledger.

### Orderbook for makers

Market makers connect directly to the Shadowbook matching engine and place limit orders. Orders are placed and cancelled instantly, removing the cost barrier that prevents active market making on Cardano.

### On-chain settlement for takers

When a taker matches an order, the trade settles on-chain through Shadowbook's smart contracts. Takers submit on-chain orders (limit or market) that the protocol's execution engine fulfills when conditions are met. The on-chain component handles custody, so takers retain full self-custody throughout the process.

### Capital efficiency

By concentrating maker liquidity in a real orderbook rather than spreading it across a bonding curve, Shadowbook delivers:

- **Tighter spreads** — makers quote competitive prices at specific levels instead of relying on a mathematical curve
- **Lower slippage** — aggregated depth at each price level means larger orders execute with less price impact
- **Faster price discovery** — makers can update quotes instantly in response to market movements

### Protocol integration

Shadowbook doesn't operate its own trading interface. Instead, it plugs into existing Cardano infrastructure as a liquidity source:

- **DexHunter** — live integration as a trading venue
- **Other DEXes and aggregators** — planned future integrations

This means traders access Shadowbook's liquidity through the interfaces they already use, without needing to learn a new platform.
