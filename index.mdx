Shadowbook is a proprietary orderbook decentralized exchange (Prop DEX) on Cardano. Unlike traditional automated market maker (AMM) DEXes, Shadowbook implements a full orderbook matching engine. The protocol allows makers to instantly place/cancel virtual limit orders that have zero on-chain cost. On the other hand, takers get tight spreads and better prices for assets compared to traditional AMMs.

Shadowbook's mission is to solve the liquidity problem of the Cardano ecosystem by providing technology for maximum capital efficiency.

For performance reasons our tech stack is fully in Rust.

## The Cardano DeFi problem

Cardano's smart contract platform doesn't support concentrated liquidity market maker pools or other capital-efficient designs. The market is dominated by constant product AMM DEXes — the least capital-efficient model in DeFi.

This creates several compounding issues:

  <Card title="Slow price adjustment" icon="clock">
    Pool prices lag behind actual market movements, creating stale quotes.

  <Card title="Poor execution" icon="chart-line-down">

    Network fees of 1–1.5 ADA per order, plus batcher and DEX fees, make frequent trading expensive.

    Liquidity is scattered across multiple pools, venues, and trading pairs.

Without user segmentation, genuine traders receive the same execution quality as arbitrageurs and trading bots. Loyal Cardano users bear the cost of all these inefficiencies.

## Shadowbook's solution

Shadowbook replaces the AMM model with a hybrid orderbook architecture designed for Cardano's eUTxO ledger.

### Virtual orderbook for makers

Market makers connect directly to the Shadowbook matching engine and place virtual limit orders. These orders live off-chain — they're placed and cancelled instantly with no transaction fees and no on-chain footprint. This removes the cost barrier that prevents active market making on Cardano.

### On-chain settlement for takers

When a taker matches an order, the trade settles on-chain through Shadowbook's smart contracts. Takers submit on-chain orders (limit or market) that the protocol's execution engine fulfills when conditions are met. The on-chain component handles custody, so takers retain full self-custody throughout the process.

### Capital efficiency

By concentrating maker liquidity in a real orderbook rather than spreading it across a bonding curve, Shadowbook delivers:

- **Tighter spreads** — makers quote competitive prices at specific levels instead of relying on a mathematical curve
- **Lower slippage** — aggregated depth at each price level means larger orders execute with less price impact
- **Faster price discovery** — makers can update quotes instantly in response to market movements

### Fee structure

| Order type | Execution fee | On-chain cost |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Market order | 0.6 ADA | Standard network fee |
| Limit order | 1.8 ADA | Standard network fee |
| Virtual order (maker) | Free | None |
| Order cancellation | None | Standard network fee |

### Protocol integration

Shadowbook doesn't operate its own trading interface. Instead, it plugs into existing Cardano infrastructure as a liquidity source:

- **DexHunter** — live integration as a trading venue
- **Other DEXes and aggregators** — planned future integrations

This means traders access Shadowbook's liquidity through the interfaces they already use, without needing to learn a new platform.
